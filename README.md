### Built with

- HTML
- CSS

### What I learned

That was an easy one. I don't know if there was any background or not but I made everything like the image which frontendmentor showed to me except the background. I learned that mastering at box-shadow is going to take a long time.

The thing that I really do like about images' placing is that you only need to set the height and the width itself set automatically.
